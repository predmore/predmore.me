# predmore.me landing page

A single-page, dark-themed landing experience for the predmore.me domain.

## Getting started

- Open `index.html` directly in your browser for a quick preview.
- For local development with live reload, use any static file server, e.g. `python3 -m http.server` and visit `http://localhost:8000`.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. Push the contents of this repository to the `main` (or default) branch on GitHub.
2. In your repository settings, open **Pages** and set the source to "Deploy from a branch" ➜ `main` ➜ `/ (root)`.
3. (Optional) Add a `CNAME` record in the repository if you are pointing the custom domain `predmore.me` at the Pages deployment.
4. Once publishing completes, your site will be live at `https://<user>.github.io/predmore.me/` or at your custom domain if configured.

## Customising

- Edit the copy inside `index.html` to change the greeting language.
- Update `styles.css` to tweak colours, typography, or layout.
- Regenerate `og-image.png` if you alter the visual direction so social shares stay on-brand.

## Accessibility & performance

The page uses semantic HTML, high colour contrast, supports reduced motion preferences, and avoids heavy assets to remain fast on GitHub Pages.
